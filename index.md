It is important to me that I maintain different interests in my life so I can continue to **further and build myself in more than one way**. I am always open to **trying new things and experiences**. I love being a student at **UCSD** because it has **helped me grow tremendeously** and I am sure I will continue to during my time here.


## Who I am as a programmer
I love to `code` because I the process of using language to create something useful. My favorite programming language is `python` because it is special to me since it is the first language I learned and introduced me to programming. I embrace the `challenges` and `debugging` since I recognize it as an important part of programming that makes my end result feel much more `rewarding`. I am excited to see what I `create` next!
